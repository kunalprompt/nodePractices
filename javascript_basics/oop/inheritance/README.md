1. Multi-level Inheritance

2. Multiple Inheritance - not supported but can be achieved, called quasi-inheritance.


**What is the Method Resolution Order in Javascript?**

**Which is the importance on __prototype__?**

**When to use Function constructors or Object constructors for creating class?**

And define it in the __prototype__ property of the class*
